This repository contains example files supporting the implementation of the CBS-MCMC method (adapted from the CBS method [1]) for atrazine degradation models, as well as example plots of energy distance [2] used for model discrimination to select the optimal experimental design. 

Folders:
- Model_variants: contains the 6 proposed models (representing degradation pathways of atrazine in soils) used for model discrimination.
- Proposed_experimental_designs: contains an Excel table with all proposed experimental designs.
- CBS-MCMC: contains example codes for the implementation of the CBS-MCMC method for sampling viable parameter sets. Example for model variant M4
- Energy_distance: contains the implementation of energy distance as a metric for optimal design of experiments. Example plots of results are also provided.
